    <!--<string name="level_00_intro_00_text_01"><b>Phishing</b>\n\n\"Phishing\" ist eine Wortsch�pfung, die eine Kombination der zwei englischen Begriffe \"phreaking\" (hacken) und \"fishing\" (angeln) darstellt. Es handelt sich hierbei um eine Technik, mit der Betr�ger im Internet versuchen, deine sensiblen Daten, wie z.B. Passw�rter, Kontodaten oder Kreditkartendaten, zu \"angeln\".\n\nDie Betr�ger nutzen diese Daten, um dir zu schaden, z.B. um dein Konto zu pl�ndern, in deinem Namen einzukaufen oder Freunde und Arbeitskollegen zu kontaktieren.\n\nUm an die sensiblen Daten zu kommen, schicken die Betr�ger dir gef�lschte Nachrichten (z.B. in Form von E-Mails, SMS, sozialen Netzwerken oder Skype). Diese Nachrichten sehen auf den ersten Blick aus wie Nachrichten von Personen oder Institutionen, denen du vertraust (z.B. von Amazon, Facebook oder deiner Bank). In der Nachricht wirst du gebeten, Daten entweder direkt zur�ckzuschicken oder �ber einen Link einzugeben. Der Link f�hrt dabei in der Regel zu einer Webseite, die auf den ersten Blick vertrauensw�rdig aussieht. Es handelt sich allerdings um eine gef�lschte Kopie, eine sogenannte Phishing-Seite. Gibt man hier seine Daten ein, werden diese sofort vom Betr�ger abgegriffen.</string>-->
    <string name="level_00_intro_00_text_01"><b>Phishing</b>\n\n\"Phishing\" is a neologism that is a combination of the two English terms representing \"phreaking\" (hack) and \"fishing\" (fishing). This is a technique fraudsters use to try to use fake messages, Distribute malicious software (such as viruses) or such as your sensitive data. Passwords, account information or credit card information, too \"fishing\".\n\nTo get the sensitive data, the scammers send you fake messages (such as emails, text messages, social networks or Skype). At first glance, these messages look like messages from people or institutions you trust (such as Amazon, Facebook, or your bank). The range of fraudulent messages ranges from messages requesting the disclosure of private data, from messages with dangerous file attachments to \"classic Phishing\" News, that is news with dangerous links. Using these classic phishing scams, the scammers want to get their potential victims to (premature) click on such dangerous links. If the recipient follows such a link, he either directly loads malware onto the device used (e.g., PC or Smartphone), or he is directed to a website of the fraudsters who pretend to be the website of the imitated institution. However, it is a fake copy, a so-called phishing site. If you enter your sensitive data here, they will be immediately picked up by the fraudsters.</string>
    <string name="level_00_finish_00_text_01"><b>Done!</b>\n\nYou have the introduction 1 successfully completed.</string>
    <string name="level_00_intro_02_text_01"><b>Send yourself an e-mail from any sender</b></string>
    <string name="level_00_intro_02_text_02">Your e-mail address:</string>
    <string name="level_00_intro_02_text_03">Sender E-Mail:</string>
    <string name="level_00_intro_02_text_04">Optional free text:</string>
    <string name="level_00_finish_00a_text_01"><b>Not arrived at Google?</b>\n\nYou probably thought you were getting to Google\'s website. Unfortunately, you can but the links in an e-mail or. In general, trust links as well as the given email sender and the rest of the email content.</string>
    <string name="level_00_intro_01_text_01"><b>General information:</b>\n\n1.) It is easy to fake the sender of an e-mail. Anyone can do this, even without much prior knowledge. Accordingly, you should be careful when evaluating the trustworthiness of news (Emails, Skype, Social Networks etc.). This is especially true if they contain a link. Not only for links that seem to be familiar to you, but also for those who, for example. �Click Here� mean, you should be careful.\n\n2.) Furthermore, clicking on links does not necessarily lead to the web address specified in the link. Most e-mail applications do not provide a way to see the real goal of links at first glance. \n\nThe real goal of a link is experienced by letting your finger on the link. Depending on the mail program, the destination is then displayed either in a small window directly next to the mouse pointer, or in the status bar at the bottom of the opened mail.\n\nPhishing-Emails and phishing websites you can <b>just</b> based on the web address (of the link) recognize. Therefore, in this app, we'll explain how to verify the authenticity of web addresses before clicking.</string>
    <string name="level_00_finish_01_text_01"><b>By the way, that does not just apply to e-mails!</b>\n\nDangers do not just lurk behind links in emails, but generally whenever you click on a link (e.g., on another website, in an SMS or in messages on Facebook or Twitter).</string>
    <string name="level_00_finish_02_text_01"><b>Anyone can create web addresses and website copies!</b>\n\nAnyone can create web addresses and website copies. Displaying an identical copy of a web page there is almost effortless and involves almost no cost. That, if you land on a website, the displayed website may look correct at first glance, but is actually the copy of a familiar website, which was created to harm you.</string>
    <string name="level_00_finish_03_text_01"><b>Original</b>\n\nIn the following we show you a part of the <b>original</b> Website of Facebook. At the web address https://m.facebook.com/ (outlined in green) you can tell that this website is the original.</string>
    <string name="level_00_finish_04_text_01"><b>Copy/Phishing website</b>\n\nIn the following we show you a part of a <b>copied</b> Website of Facebook or \"<b>Phishing-Website</b>\", the under the fake web address https://pages.no-phish.de/ (outlined in red) is shown.</string>
    <string name="level_00_finish_05_text_01"><b>Detect a phishing website</b>\n\nIt is important that you always check the web address before entering data on the website, especially if you receive an unexpected email with a link.\n\nWith this app you learn how to use the Check web addresses.</string>
    <string name="level_00_finish_06_text_01"><b>Further gameplay</b>\n\n,Because there are different types of attacks that can be detected when checking web addresses, we have divided the tasks into different levels. \n\nEach level consists of two parts:</string>

    <string name="level_00_finish_06_text_03">Collect tasks to score</string>

Unfortunately there are some other species as well. If you want to know more about this later, then click in the menu \"More information\".</string>
    <string name="level_00_finish_08_text_01"><b>Here we go!</b>\n\nBefore you drop us off the chair from boredom, Let\'s do it a bit more interactive and start the game. In the first two levels necessary basic knowledge is taught. In the following levels you will learn, Detect phishing attacks based on web addresses.</string>

    <!-- Level E2 - ADRESSLEISTE -->
    <string name="level_01_intro_00_text_01_old"><b>The address bar</b>\n\nFirst, you need to know how to get to the web address with your smartphone. This is the same with every Android browser. Two things are important for this:\n\n1.) Find the address bar.\n2.) View the web address completely.</string>
    <string name="level_01_intro_00_text_01">The Who section is the most important area for detecting phishing URLs. In the jargon he is called domain. Usually this is displayed in the status bar.\n\nOn mobile devices (Smartphones und Tablets) the procedure depends on identifying the web address that is behind a link, however, strongly from the device. Mostly you have to press the link for about 2 seconds, but you do not click it.\n\nBelow are the two most commonly used systems, Android and iOS.</string>
    <string name="level_01_intro_00_button_01">I can do that already!</string>
    <string name="level_01_intro_01_text_01_old"><b>Find the address bar</b>\n\nMany websites are so extensive, that the actual website is displayed on the entire display and therefore the address bar is not visible.\n\nBut you can pull down the finger on the website so long (if necessary several times), until you arrive at the top of the web page and the address bar appears.</string>
    <string name="level_01_intro_02_text_01_old"><b>View the web address completely</b>\n\nUnfortunately, once the address bar appears, you will not always see the full web address, as it is often too long. However, it is very important to look at them as a whole.\n\nTo view the entire web address, you have to tap the address text with your finger.</string>
    <string name="level_01_intro_01_text_01"><b>Android\n</b></string>
    <string name="level_01_intro_02_text_01"><b>iOS\n</b></string>
    <string name="level_01_intro_03_text_01"><b>View the web address completely</b>\n\nAs a result, the web address will be highlighted and you will see the end of the web address.</string>
    <string name="level_01_intro_03_text_02">Now you have to drag the web address to the right with your finger (if necessary several times), until you reach the beginning of the web address.</string>
    <string name="level_01_intro_03_text_03">By pulling left and right, you can look at the entire web address.</string>
    <string name="level_01_finish_00_text_01"><b>Done!</b>\n\nYou have completed the Introduction 2 successfully.</string>
    <string name="level_01_finish_00_text_02"><b>Hints:</b> In the following levels, you\'ll learn how to differentiate trusted web addresses from phishing web addresses (called phishs).</string>

    <!-- Lasse dir die Webadressen zuk�nftig genau so anzeigen, wie du es hier gelernt hast, um die Webadresse zu �berpr�fen. Dies ist besonders dann wichtig, wenn du eine unerwartete E-Mail mit einem Link erh�ltst.
    -->
    <!-- LEVEL 1 - WEB-ADRESSEN -->
    <string name="level_02_intro_00_text_01"><b>Structure of web addresses</b>\n\nTo recognize a fake website based on web addresses, It is important to understand the structure of a web address. In this and the following levels you will learn this gradually.\n\nFirst an example of a web address:</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_00_text_02_url">http://abo.spiegel.de/spiegel-digital</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_01_text_01"><b>The important components of a web address</b>\n\nWeb addresses are very complex. For this reason, we would like to explain everything as simplified as possible. For this we look at the website, that you visit, from now on as yours \"Interlocutor\". Already in the web address you will learn (as in a conversation) the first important information, which we will discuss in more detail later.</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_02_text_01"><b>The important components of a web address</b>\n\nThe following graphic summarizes what the individual parts of a web address say about the conversation.</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_02_text_02">The purple area represents the security level of the conversation. Possibilities for this are \"http://\" and \"https://\". What the difference is, you will experience in an advanced level. The area highlighted in blue gives you information about the person you are talking to and the orange area tells you the topic of conversation. This area may also be missing.</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_03_text_01"><b>Focus - Information about the conversation partner himself</b>\n\nIn this and the next few levels, we will mainly deal with the blue-backed part of the web address, because it is very important to know who your interlocutor is! \ n \ nThe area <b>between \""http://\" and the third Slash \"/\"</b> So gives you information about your conversation partner, talk about the website. You can now ignore the remaining areas.</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_04_text_01"><b>Structure of the interlocutor area</b>\n\nThis area is divided into individual blocks by dots.\n\n<b>Remember:</b> These blocks are read from right to left.</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_05_text_01"><b>Location information</b>\n\nThe first block (from the right) tells you that \"Location\" your conversation partner. In this case \"de\" for Germany.</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_06_text_01"><b>Information about the conversation partner</b>\n\nThe second block (from the right) tells you which one \"Companies\"" your conversation partner belongs.</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_07_text_01"><b>Details of departments</b>\n\nFrom the third block (from the right), describe all remaining blocks (there may be several) different\"Departments\" of your conversation partner.</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_08_text_01"><b>The Who area</b>\n\nThe most important two blocks of a web address are the first two blocks (viewed from the right) in the area \"Information about conversation partners\". We call him \"Who area\" (Company + Location). This area must be from each interlocutor,(i.e. each website), to be registered at one central location. Already registered names can not be registered again. These two blocks tell you, <b>who</b> your conversation partner <b>really</b> is, so you should always identify and check them.</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_08_domain_description">Who area\n(Conversation partner + Location)</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_08_subdomain_description">Departments</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_09_text_01"><b>Examples</b>\n\nBelow are a few examples of web addresses. First, think about which area in the given web addresses is the who-area. Then check your results by continuing.</string>
    <string name="level_02_intro_10_text_01"><b>Examples - Resolution</b>\n\nBelow are a few examples of web addresses. First, think about which area in the given web addresses is the who-area. Then check your results by continuing.</string>
    <string name="level_02_outro">If you are unsure as to who your conversational partner is, ask for help directly with him.</string>
    <string name="level_02_exercise_text_01">Now it\'s your turn:\n\nAfter the previous examples, you should now determine yourself who the Who-range of the following web addresses.\n\nTouch the appropriate place and click on \"�berpr�fen\", if your answer is to be checked.</string>
    <string name="level_02_task"><b>Tap</b> now the who area of the following web addresses.</string>
    <string name="level_02_you_are_wrong">Unfortunately, you could not identify the Who section. Therefore, you lose a life.</string>
    <string name="level_02_you_are_correct">Very good! You were able to identify the who area.</string>
    <string name="level_finished"><b>Done!</b>\n\nCongratulations! You have completed the level successfully. On to the next Level!</string>

    <!-- Level 2 - IP NO BRAND-->
    <string name="level_04_intro_00_text_01"><b>Attack by IP address as the who area</b>\n\nPhishers use various deceptions, to make web addresses trustworthy, although they are not.\n\nYou will gradually learn with which tricks they try, to fool you.\n\nIn this level, we'll cover one of the simplest tricks of using IP addresses instead of terms in the who's area of the web address.</string>
    <string name="level_04_intro_01_text_01"><b>IP-Addresses</b>\n\nJust as our homes are addressed by street names, computers are identified on the Internet with so-called IP-Address.</string>

    <string name="level_03_intro_03_text_02">Phishers can easily use known interlocutors in their departments, to deceive you. So do not rely on this area. Also always look at the most important two blocks of the web address, the who-area. Does the section of the departments contain the well-known interlocutors and contains the Who section but nonsense, disinterested or even trustworthy interlocutors instead of the name of your interlocutor, then <b>Do not enter any data on this website!</b>\n\nBelow is an example of a phishing web address that applies this principle. In the example your partner is badcat.de and secure-update.com (blue). This is the main area of the web address, the who area. Your conversation partner is not google.com or microsoft.com! These two are just the names of a department of each company. This area is not relevant to your investigation of the web address.

The phisher can take a familiar Who section of a website, incorporate a typo or even a misspelling in the name and then register that name as its creator. So always look at the most important two blocks of the web address, the Who section. So read this area letter by letter. Does the Who-Area contain a typo or a speller, then <b>Do not enter any data on this website!</b>\n\nBelow is an example of a phishing web address that applies this principle.

    <!-- LEVEL 9 - https and http -->
    <string name="level_10_intro_00_text_01"><b>The security level of the conversation</b>\n\nDiscussions with companies can have a low or high security level. The first section of a web address gives you information about the security level. In this level we are dealing with this area.</string>
    <string name="level_10_intro_02_text_01"><b>The scope of the security level</b>\n\nDuring the game you encountered two different variants of the security level, whose meaning you have not yet met: https:// and http://. The first section of the web address represents the security level. We will with the explanation of https:// begin and then border on it from http:// .</string>
    <string name="level_10_intro_02_after_http_01">www.deutsche-bank.de/</string>
    <string name="level_10_intro_03_text_01"><b>https</b>\n\nCaptures a web address https:// on, is a high-security conversation (if the browser does not warn you). The https:// assures you the following:\n\n1.) Your conversation gets no other (encryption of communication).\n\n2.) Your interlocutor can identify himself to a third trustworthy party (authentication of the interlocutor).</string>
    <string name="level_10_intro_04_text_01"><b>https - Encryption of communication</b>\n\nCaptures a web address https:// on, it means that the conversation takes place in a closed space, away from the public. That nobody gets to know what you are talking about with the website gets me what you talk about with the website or which user input you submit (Username, password, account information, etc.). The communication is thus encrypted. Especially when entering passwords or other sensitive data, encryption is very important.\n\nIn the following example is your conversation partner deutsche-bank.de (blue background). It will https:// used (purple background), i.e. nobody can read what data you send to deutsche-bank.de.</string>
    <string name="level_10_intro_05_text_01"><b>https - Authentication of the conversation partner</b>\n\nThe https:// also assures you that your interlocutor, who is indicated in the Who area, is really this one. In detail, the identity of your interlocutor was checked by a so-called certification body.\n\nIn the following example is your conversation partner deutsche-bank.de (blue background). The web address starts with https (purple background). Thus, a certification authority confirms the identity of you deutsche-bank.de.</string>
    <string name="level_10_intro_06_text_01"><b>http</b>\n\nCaptures a web address http:// On, the conversation is a low security level. The http:// means the following:\n\n1.) Everyone can hear your conversation, i.e. the communication becomes <b>Not</b> encoded\n\n2.) Your correspondent did not identify himself to a third trustworthy party\n\nFor user input (user name, password, account data, etc.) you are in public, everyone can hear this. The communication is therefore not encrypted. In addition, you can not be sure that the specified in the Wer-area conversation partner is actually the one, for which he pretends. Therefore, you should not enter sensitive data on such websites, even if the Who-area is in order. Instead, you should contact the provider and point out this problem.</string>
    <string name="level_10_intro_07_text_01"><b>Only add https:// Data</b>\n\nWIf you enter data on a website, you should always make sure that https:// is used so that no one can read your data and they do not fall into the wrong hands. So, if you checked the who section and additionally https:// is used, you can be sure that no one can read your input and that they do not fall into the wrong hands.</string>
    <string name="level_10_intro_08_text_01"><b>Danger! Never rely solely on the existence of https://</b>, because even phishers can use https:// .  So always look at the who\'s area to be sure, that you really communicate with exactly the person you wanted to communicate with.\n\nIn the following example your contact is phisher.de (blue background), and not facebook. The https:// confirms that your conversation partner really phisher.de is and that no one else can hear your conversation with him.<b>Do not let go of it https:// to deceive, do not enter any data here!</b></string>
    <string name="level_10_intro_09_text_01"><b>Comment</b>\n\nSome websites do not use by default https://, when the user needs to enter data. <b>Consequently, you should always pay particular attention when entering data, who is your conversation partner and whether https:// is used. If no https:// used, you can try that http:// the web address with https:// to replace and press Enter.</b> More information about https:// you find in Level 10.\n\nPlease lean any in this level http:// Web addresses, even if the Who range is okay. Also pay attention to phishing websites that use https:// !</string>

    <!-- FINAL REMARKS LEVEL -->
    <string name="level_11_intro_00_text_01"><b>Congratulations!</b>\n\nYou made it through all levels. Finally, we would like to give you some valuable hints.</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_01_text_01"><b>Confusing but legitimate web addresses</b>\n\nIn this game you have learned, as you can see from web addresses, if you are on a phishing website. To describe many relevant features in an understandable way, we introduced the analogy, to view the visited website as your conversation partner. The web address provides you with relevant information about the conversation.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes it happens that the web addresses of legitimate websites, look suspiciously like phishing web addresses.\n\nOn the following pages we would like to give you two examples.</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_02_text_01"><b>Confusing but legitimate web addresses</b>\n\nThe regular website of Commerzbank can be reached at the web address given below. The Who-Area in commerzbank.com (highlighted in blue). So far, the web address looks very trustworthy, which it is.</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_02_text_02">If the user now wants to conduct online banking, he will reach the web address given below. Here is the Who-Area at once commerzbanking.de (highlighted in blue). As you can see, the Who section is just a similar variation of the Who section of the regular Commerzbank website, i.e. you would identify this website as phishing. This is not a phishing web address.</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_04_text_01"><b>Confusing but legitimate web addresses</b>\n\nHere\'s another example of two legitimate web addresses, the second looks like a phishing web address, but it\'s not:</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_03_text_01"><b>Help us to make the internet safer</b>\n\nSometimes legitimate web addresses can look like phishing web addresses. That\'s why it\'s important, <b>to know exactly</b>, What are the areas of your visited websites!\nIn such confusing cases, we would like to suggest that you contact the appropriate company or bank. For example, you can find the contact details using Google\'s search engine. Never use the contact information provided on a potential Phishing-Website. Do not enter any data before you have made sure! First, this way you can be sure that you will not enter data on fake websites. Second, you can complain why the company or bank is using and contributing to such confusing web addresses, to make the internet a bit safer.</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_05_text_01"><b>https://</b>\n\nYou have learned that https:// a web address assures two things:\n\n1.) Your conversation gets no other (encryption of communication).\n\n2.) Your interlocutor can identify himself to a third trustworthy party (authentication of the interlocutor).</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_06_text_01"><b>https:// - Authentication of the conversation partner</b>\n\nThis means that a so-called trusted certification authority assures that the interlocutor is really who he claims to be. This certification authority will perform certain identity checks and post on a successful review of the Who-Area a so-called certificate. This certificate assures you that the person you are talking to is really the person listed in the who\'s area.</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_07_text_01"><b>https:// - Identity Tests</b>\n\nUnfortunately, the great competition and the price pressure among the certification bodies leads in part to superficial and simplified awarding of certificates. It is possible for certificates to confirm identities that they should not confirm! For this reason special certificates (Extended Validation SSL Certificates) were introduced, issued under even more stringent identity verification by specialized certification bodies. Some internet browsers (unfortunately not the Android browser) offer the possibility of websites with such special certificates, to recognize at first glance. Recognizable here on the green area (lock + separately displayed company name)</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_07_text_02">More information can be found at <b>bsi-fuer-buerger.de (www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de).</b>  Here you will generally find some more information on how to safely navigate the web.\n\nGood luck revealing phishing websites. Do not let yourself be tricked!</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_08_text_01"><b>Clicking on links can be dangerous!</b>\n\nIn this game, you learned how to recognize by web addresses, if you are on a phishing website. We have focused on detecting the attack when you are on the website, as links can be fake as well.\n\nNevertheless, you should not, unreasonably, click on links if you do not trust a message from the beginning. It is possible to download malware by clicking on malicious links. Therefore, you should check the web address before clicking. It is important to know what information you can rely on;  i.d.R. in the web context on the display bottom left in the browser. Critical are web addresses that you scan with a QR code scanner. Some scanners open the web page directly without displaying the web address. We therefore recommend the Privacy-Friendly QR Code Scanner, developed in the SECUSO Group.</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_09_text_01"><b>More tricks</b>\n\nYou\'ve learned several tricks that phishers use to fool Internet users. However, there are other tricks that we have not dealt with in the game. The following are just examples:\n\n<u><i>Tiny-URL</i></u>\nIt can happen that a phisher calls a so-called "Short Link" (Tiny-URL) used to disguise the real goal. \n\nFor example, http://tinyurl.com/nskuf85 \n\to the NoPhish website \n\nhttps://www.secuso.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/secuso-home/research/results/nophish \n\nShort links are abbreviated forms of web addresses. To facilitate the typing of web addresses. You can only check the URL after the resolution. You can use the following service for this: \n\n <b>http://getlinkinfo.com/</b> \n\nOn the safe side you are, if you do not click on the link but manually enter the web address with the known Who-Area.</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_10_text_01"><u><i>Referrer</i></u>\nA referrer is submitted whenever a user visits a website through a link on another page. By means of a so-called Dereferrers one can now "disguise", from which website you originally come. If, for example, a link is called via GMX, a dereferencer is set before the actual destination URL. The original page is here �<u>gmx.net</u>� and the destination page "<u>info.allyouneed.com</u>".\n\nhttps://<b>deref-gmx.net</b>/mail/client/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=http%3A%2F%2F<b>info.allyouneed.com</b>%2Fgo%2F0%2F1LNSD479-1LM9YF2U-1L9EOOAX-VRYAL9.html%3Frid%3D12YEEUIW-19J53LF\n\nHere the web browser first calls up the gmx page and then opens up<u>info.allyouneed.com</u> forwarded. The Who-Area �<u>deref-gmx.net</u>� Unfortunately this does not say anything about the actual destination of the link. This method is e.g. applied to it, to hide secret data in the original URL like e.g. the existence of the referring website.\n\n<u><i>ccTLD</i></u>\nFurthermore, there are so-called ccTLDs (country-specific Top-Level-Domains). The Top-Level-Domain represents here the Who-Area. There are many legitimate websites that use this method, e.g. <u>www.amazon.co.uk</u>. After the rules learned before (�Just look at the last two areas before the third slash�) would as a Who-Area only <u>co.uk</u> to be viewed as, In this case, unfortunately, has no significance for the actual legitimacy of the website. The co stands here only for "commercial" thus for a commercial enterprise and uk for the United Kingdom.\n\n\nThese two tricks are currently not addressed by the rules of NoPhish yet. In future releases, however, we will extend the rules to include input for these tricks.</string>
    <string name="level_11_intro_11_text_01"><u><i>Country Code</i></u>\nPhishers also try to use other country codes:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.ss\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinstead of\nhttps://www.amazon.de\n\nIn this training, the focus was on the name of the interlocutor. Often this is enough. To be sure, it is also necessary to check the country code. Here there are not only country codes but also those for cities (e.g. .Berlin) or organizations (.org).\nIt is therefore important, When registering on a page, you not only remember the name of the person you are talking about in the Who section, but also the country code.\n\n<u><i>Psychological Tricks</i></u>\nPhishers often use tricks to get you to click on a link. That\'s what happened in the past, that (time) pressure was built up, because otherwise the account will be blocked. \nA new trick is to offer you two links. e.g. that a bank transaction has been carried out. It will then be offered a link for �I have not done any transaction� and a link for �Yes, I have initiated this transaction�.</string>
