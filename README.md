#NoPish
Phishing is a major issue of the Internet where users are tricked into disclosing their confidential data, such as login or credit card information, usually via fraudulent websites. The gained information is exploited by the phishers with the purpose of impersonating their victims for financial benefits. 

The most reliable way to detect phishing is checking the URL (web address) of a website. We developed an **Android app** to learn how to detect Phishing URLs.

**The app is avaliable here:** https://www.secuso.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/research/results/nophish-android-app-deutsch/

##Contributions
Bergmann and Gamze Canova (alumni of SecUSo) developed the original NoPhish Android App during their Master’s thesis and continued working on it afterwards. 
Since April 2015 it is now enhanced and maintained by other SecUSo members.
